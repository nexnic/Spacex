        <h2>Funder Elon Musk</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/spacex_6.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
          businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
          SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
          multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
          Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that
          would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space
          Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in
          2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an
          advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
          administration.

        <h2>Mission statement</h2>
        <p>
          “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to
          be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all
          about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future
          will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more
          exciting than going out there and being among the stars.” <br />
          <br />

        <h2>MAKING HUMANITY MULTIPLANETARY</h2>
        <p>
          Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is
          working on a next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that
          will be the most powerful ever built, capable of carrying humans to
          Mars and other destinations in the solar system.

        <h2>MAKING HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic
          milestones. It is the only private company capable of returning a
          spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 our Dragon spacecraft
          became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from
          the International Space Station. And in 2020, SpaceX became the first
          private company to take humans there as well. Click through the
          timeline above to see some of our milestone accomplishmen
