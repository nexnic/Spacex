# Spacex

assignment from bootcamp active learning, spacex api

# Exam first assignment

During the weeks we have been working with Javascript, you got to start a project called SpaceX. You must now complete this. In the SpaceX
task, you use an API that contains different information from SpaceX, which you will continue to use.
The SpaceX page should contain a front page that has an exciting and inviting front page about SpaceX. You will also have a launch page, where you show the launches from SpaceX. Use what you have learned in JavaScript to sort the launches from success, failed and upcoming, and apply a solution where you sort this nicely.
You will also need an about us page, and a contact page where you use a form. It is not necessary to create a figma design for this project, but be creative with the solution anyway and pay attention to WCAG principles.
